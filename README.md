Hello there! I'm changing from the world of electrical engineering to the vast and challenging world of software development. To that end, I bring to the table my passion for algorithms and knowing how things work under the hood. 

In the past, I worked with C++ to make desktop apps but nowadays, I'm diving into back-end technologies and APIs for the web, particularly with Java and Spring.
