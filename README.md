Hi, I’m André Rangel. I'm an electrical engineer and I'm pursuing a carreer change to the data science field. This repository aims to host most of my projects to accomplish this task.

About my work:

Along the way, I discovered the world of data science and my idea for a
master thesis is about detecting and diagnose faults in a power converter. Perhaps a good way to combine these two disciplines: electrical engineering and data science. Such skills benefits the converter with an increase in reliability to support applications at rigorous industries. 

Talk to me at my email: andre.rangel.pro@gmail.com

Peace!
