Hi, Iâ€™m @andrevier from Brazil. I'm currently finishing my master degree in power electronics and  
I'm using github to host all my master thesis files in the mestrado_ElePot.

About my work:

Along the way I discovered the world of data science and my idea for a
master thesis is about detecting and diagnose faults in a power converter. Perhaps a good way to combine these two disciplines: electrical engineering and data science and
that such abilities benefits the converter with an increase in reliability to support applications at rigorous industries. 

Talk to me at my email: andrevierdc@gmail.com

Peace!
