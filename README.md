## Introduction
Hello, I'm Andr√©, a passionate software developer with a curiosity for how things work and a love for engineering. My journey into programming began with a fascination for understanding computers and their inner workings.

During my studies, I dived into evolutionary computing and gained practical experience in software development using C++. The more I coded, the more I realized the immense power it holds. Building applications with a laptop that can change people's lives worldwide is truly mind-blowing!

Currently, I specialize in backend and API development, particularly with Java. I excel at conceptualizing and implementing app concepts, designing relational databases, and crafting efficient queries. I leverage PostgreSQL and Spring Boot to build robust REST APIs. Thorough testing and following Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles are crucial to me.
Projects

In addition to mastering the necessary tools, I believe in the significance of:

1. **Strong Foundations:** Continuously learning and adapting foundational concepts to suit various situations.
2. **Problem Decomposition:** Breaking down complex problems into manageable, smaller tasks for effective problem-solving.
3. **Effective Communication:** Collaborating and communicating effectively with team members and stakeholders.

## Projects

Here are some of my noteworthy projects:

### [issue_tracker](https://github.com/andrevier/issue_tracker)

An issue tracker is a powerful software that enables users to log and manage issues within a project. It serves as a comprehensive solution to record and track bugs, tasks, and to-do lists efficiently.

### [My Documents](https://github.com/andrevier/mydocuments)

"My Documents" is a straightforward web application designed for note-taking. It empowers users to create, read, update, and delete their documents effortlessly. This project showcases my proficiency in web development, database management, security implementation, and user management.

### [Basic Authentication](https://github.com/andrevier/basicAuth/tree/master)

The "Basic Authentication" repository provides an excellent example of a minimal implementation of security using the Spring Security framework. It demonstrates my knowledge and expertise in creating secure applications while adhering to industry best practices.
